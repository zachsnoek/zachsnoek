# 👋🏻 Hey, I'm Zach!

👨🏻‍💻 I'm a self-starting Senior Software Engineer who spearheads complex, cross-functional projects from ideation to launch. I have extensive startup experience, and thrive in fast-paced, ambiguous environments that demand ownership.

📝 I frequently write about code on my [blog](https://www.zachsnoek.com/blog) and for publications such as [Twilio's blog](https://www.twilio.com/blog/author/zach-snoek), [LogRocket's blog](https://blog.logrocket.com/author/zachsnoek/), and [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/author/zachsnoek/).
